## Jenkins

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Srivirat85/rep1/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

1. Numbered

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```
